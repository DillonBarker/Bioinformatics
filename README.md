# Bioinformatics

I studied Biochemistry whilst at University. So here is something I wanted to play around with, as it applies to what I am already comfortable with and also getting to learn more about python.

## What I did
I used various python packages to look into the proteins of SARS-CoV2 whilst on lockdown. Since it was topical and as I had already done some work on viruses whilst at University. Specifically I was looking at the spike protein from the SARS-Cov2 genome and comparing this to the spike from SARS-CoV, to see any potential differences that could be exploited.

## A cool article that talks about spike proteins

### Biopython
This was a very cool package that I used, it seems it is one of the largest for python and has so many different functionalities. I used it here to read and decipher a DNA sequence to get the respective proteins.

### Swiss PDB viewer
The PDB viewer is what I used at University to look at proteins and compare them, here I used it to compare the two sequences in question.
