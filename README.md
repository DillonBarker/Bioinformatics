# Bioinformatics

I studied Biochemistry whilst at University. So this stuff I find very enjoyable. Just something I wanted to play around with since starting to learn python. I used various python packages to look into the proteins of SARS-CoV2 whilst on lockdown. Since it was topical and as I had already done some work on viruses whilst at University.
